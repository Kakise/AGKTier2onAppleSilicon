# AGK Tier2

A community collaboration repository for AppGameKit Tier 2

## Introduction

AppGameKit is feature packed with over 1,900 commands! Even after all these years we still get asked to add a myriad of new features. For this reason, we’re creating this community GitHub repository to encourage the more experienced developers within the community to help extend the features of AppGameKit.

## Source Code Access

You can now download a copy of the very latest source code to the AppGameKit Tier2 engine, complete with instructions on how to gather the prerequisites, dependencies and other files required to compile, test and run your own implementation of the AppGameKit Libraries for PC, Mac and Linux. Note that this does not include the Tier1 Compiler or Tier1 Broadcaster.

## Issues Tracker

At any time, you can review current issues, report new ones and for moderators and collaborations, even tick off bugs that have been fixed, or edit them with additional details to keep the work of solving critical issues alive. No more digging around forums and social feeds for whether a bug has been reported, or how to report one, as it's now all under one roof.

## Community Collaboration

The best aspect of our repository access is that we can now include other developers in helping us expand the commands in Tier2. Where possible we recommend any new commands are coded in C++ so that they are cross platform. Where new commands are truly cross platform they can then be considered for inclusion into Tier1 AppGameKit. If you would like to be involved and help develop new commands then please get in touch.
